# How Our NFT Game Works: From Start to Finish

Hey NFT gamers! Let's dive into how our game really works under the hood. It's pretty clever, and understanding it might just give you an edge!

## Getting Started: Minimum Contributions

Entry starts at 0.01 ETH (about $25 at $2500/ETH) for all games, regardless of floor price.
This minimum increases as the game progresses, based on total funds and the NFT's floor price. The increase is non-linear, with the most significant jumps happening in the early stages of funding.

![Min contribution algorithm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xkieranwilliams/nft-roulette-game/refs/heads/main/assets/imgs/min-contribution-fee-algo.svg)



Examples of how the minimum could range in different games:

1. 0.2 ETH floor price game: 0.01 ETH to 0.016 ETH
2. 0.8 ETH floor price game: 0.01 ETH to 0.064 ETH
3. ...
4. 6.8 ETH floor price game: 0.01 ETH to 0.544 ETH
5. 7.4 ETH floor price game: 0.01 ETH to 0.592 ETH
6. 8.0 ETH floor price game: 0.01 ETH to 0.640 ETH

Once the minimum contribution reaches 8% of the floor price it doesn't increase further

So, whether you're dipping your toes in the kiddie pool or diving into the deep end, there's a game for every budget! The bigger the NFT, the bigger the potential minimum buy-in. But hey, no risk, no reward, right?

## The Band System: Your Ticket to the Big Leagues

You're not just playing, you're climbing the ladder of success! Your contribution puts you in a "band":

1. Band 1: 0% - 19% of floor price (Hey, we all start somewhere!)
2. Band 2: 20% - 29% of floor price (Now we're cooking!)
3. ...
10. Band 10: Over 120% of floor price (Whoa there, high roller!)

Higher bands = better winning chances! It's like buying a first-class ticket to Winnersville, population: hopefully you!

## Leveling Up: Because Who Doesn't Love a Good Upgrade?

Stuck in Band 3? Feeling like a small fish in a big pond? Fear not! You can beef up your position faster than you can say "to the moon":

- Started in Band 3? You can climb to Band 7 with a top-up. It's like giving your chances a turbo boost!
- Feeling lucky? Push into Band 10 and strut your stuff at the top.
- See others making moves? Don't just sit there - level up and show 'em who's boss!

## How Winners Are Chosen: May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor

1. We pick a winning band. (Higher bands are like VIP passes - better odds, baby!)
2. Then we randomly choose a winner from that band. (Even underdogs have their day!)

So if you're in Band 10, you're not just playing the game, you're practically running it. But hey, even the little guys can win big - that's the beauty of chance!

## Game Tax: Keeping the Lights On (and Maybe Buying You Dinner Later)

We skim a little off the top, but it's all for a good cause (you!):

- Treasury Fee: 3% (Think of it as an investment in your future fun)
- Developer Fee: 2% (Gotta keep those hamsters running in their wheels)

Don't worry, this only happens when the game wraps up. During play, every wei is working hard for you!

## How the Game Ends: All Good Things Must Come to an End (But Some End Better Than Others)

Three ways this rollercoaster can stop:

1. **Normal Ending**: 
   The creator's set game duration says "time's up!", we consult our crystal ball (aka secure random number generator), and voila! Someone's walking away with a shiny new NFT, and the game creator hopefully gets paid more for their NFT than they would selling it at the floor value!! üéâ 

2. **Game Cancellation**:
   Something went sideways? Few players joined the game? üò™ No worries! The creator can pull the plug after the game duration, the NFT goes home, and you get a refund. It's like a fire drill, but for your wallet.

3. **Player Refunds**:
   If the game gets cancelled, don't just sit there - claim your share! It's like getting money back on a sweater you never wore, except it's ETH and you had fun not wearing it.

## Why We Do This: Method to Our Madness

- It's dynamic: Because who doesn't love a plot twist?
- It's fair: Early bird? Night owl? We love you both!
- It supports the ecosystem: Small fees today, big fun tomorrow!

## Pro Tips: Become the Smarty Pants of NFT Gaming

1. Start where you're comfy, then ride the wave.
2. Feeling the heat? Crank it up to 11 (or at least Band 9).
3. Band 5 and up? You're not just playing, you're competing.
4. Early bird gets the lower minimum contribution worm.
5. Game cancelled? Claim that refund like it's the last slice of pizza!

Remember, in this game you're not climbing a corporate ladder, you're scaling the bands of chance! Where will you land? Only time (and your ETH) will tell!

This isn't just a game, it's a thrill ride with an NFT cherry on top. So insert your ETH, strap in, and let's see if you've got what it takes to win these NFTs! May your contributions be mighty and your bands be high!
